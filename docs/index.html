			<h1>Workshop on Software Engineering for Robotics (SE4Robotics'23)</h1> 
		 
		   <p><h4>
				 The  workshop will bring together thought leaders from academia and industry, in robotics and software engineering, to identify   key problems in software  engineering for robotics that we should tackle in the next 5 years, and  to coalesce a community around those problems. The workshop will produce a roadmap for the community, as well as generate new connections, collaborations, and synergy amongst diverse researchers interested in this problem domain.

				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				The  progress in robot development and its impact in the last decade have been astounding. Yet, software engineering techniques and tools have not kept up with this revolution, and in many cases are hindering it. Current techniques are challenged by the diversity of (1) robots, environments, and clients being deployed, (2) inputs they consume and technologies they employ, and (3)  engineersâ€™ backgrounds. Handling this diversity requires a dramatic shift in the development of the robot software stack. Looking ahead to robots that are more ubiquitous and autonomous only makes this shift more pressing.
