			<h1><abbr title="Workshop on Software Engineering for Robotics">SE4Robotics'23</abbr><br></h1>
			<p>
				The NSF sponsored Workshop brings together thought leaders from academia and industry, in robotics and sofware engineering, to identify   key problems in Software
Engineering for Robotics that we should tackle in the next 5 years, and  to coalesce a
community around those problems. The workshop will produce a roadmap for the community, as well as generate new connections, collaborations, and synergy amongst researchers interested in this problem domain, from a diversity of perspectives

				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				Robots are experiencing a revolution as they permeate many aspects of our daily life,from performing house maintenance to conducting remote surgeries. This progress and its impact are astounding, especially considering the challenges in developing these systems with states governed in part by physical and temporal constraints, distributed components, susceptibility to noise, and imbued with safety concerns. Yet, software development techniques and tools have not kept up with this revolution, and in many cases is hindering it. Current techniques are challenged by the diversity of (1) robots, scenarios, and clients being deployed, (2) inputs they take and technologies they employ, and (3) environments and engineersâ€™ backgrounds resulting from the robotic revolution. These dimensions of diversity require a dramatic shift in the development of the robot software stack. Looking ahead to future-generation of robots that are more ubiquitous, autonomous, and reliant on adaptive components, hardware, and data only makes this shift more pressing.

				<h2>Agenda and Goals</h2>
				Two broad guiding questions will drive the agenda: (1) What are the most distinctive current and emerging software engineering practices in the robotics domain that require specialized support?, and (2) What are the major software engineering pain points in robotics and how are those expected to shift in the future to require
                transformational software engineering techniques? 
                Based on the questions, the workshop will aim to achieve a couple of goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>  refine the answers we currently have for those questions
                    given the multiple sources of diversity identified in the motivation, and assist in collecting such diverse practices being used across robotic research labs and industry today</li>
                    <li> identify sources of impedance in the application of existing software engineering technology that can bring the communities closer together, as well as software engineering technology gaps that need to be addressed as robots become even more ubiquitous </li>
                </ul>

				<h2>Impact</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Exchange of ideas that is currently lacking across software engineering and robotics communities, bringing together leading researchers from industry and academia</li>
                    <li>New research directions, pain points, and opportunities identified by experts from both communities has the potential to provide the seeds for new interactions, collaborations, and programs at the intersections of the communities </li> 
                    <li> A report summarizing the discussions and findings will be made publicly available and shared with both communities to promote its agenda for change </li>
